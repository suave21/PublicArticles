          The tropical rainforest is a hot, moist biome found near Earth's equator. 
		  The world's largest tropical rainforests are in South America, Africa, 
		  and Southeast Asia. Tropical rainforests receive from 60 to 160 inches 
		  of precipitation that is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year. 
		  The combination of constant warmth and abundant moisture makes the tropical 
		  rainforest a suitable environment for many plants and animals. Tropical 
		  rainforests contain the greatest biodiversity in the world. Over 15 million 
		  species of plants and animals live within this biome.

          Because of the great diversity of plants in the tropics, naming indicator
		  species is very difficult unless you are a botanist. Certainly, a number
		  of plant groups reach their greatest diversity here, but picking out 
		  individual species would be difficult.  I've put the chocolate tree here 
		  as a representative simply because just about everyone knows what chocolate 
		  is.  The chocolate is harvested from the pod you see growing here; the pods 
		  develop from flowers which are borne directly on the trunk.  This gives a 
		  good point of attachment for what will become a heavy pod.  Chocolate is 
		  native to the new world tropics, but has been transplanted to tropical 
		  regions around the world.
